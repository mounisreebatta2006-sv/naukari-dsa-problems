Problem statement
You have been given a binary tree of integers. You have to return all the diagonal paths of the binary tree. A diagonal path is one in which all the nodes pass through -1 slope line.
A binary tree is a tree in which each parent node has at most two children.
Note:
Order of return of diagonal path’s array/vector: The rightmost diagonal path must come first, and so on.
Every parent node comes first then the child node. In other words, return the diagonal element from top to bottom.
Sample Input 1:
2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 2 3 -1 -1 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1
Sample Output 1:
 1 3 7 2 5 6 4
 1 3 5 2 4

class Node
{
int data;
Node left;
Node right;
Node(int data)
{
this.data=data;
this.left=null;
this.right=null;
}
}
class Solution
{
public ArrayList<Integer> diagtrav(Node root)
{
Queue<Node>queue=new LinkedList<>();
queue.offer(root);
ArrayList<Integer>result=new ArrayList<>();
while(!queue.isEmpty())
{
Node curr=queue.poll();
while(curr!=null)
{
result.add(curr.data);
if(curr.left!=null)
{
queue.offer(curr.left);
}
curr=curr.right;
}
}
return result;
}
}
