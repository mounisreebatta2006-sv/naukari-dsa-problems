Problem statement
You are given the root node of a binary tree.
Return 'true' if it is a height balanced binary tree.
Note:
Height of a tree is the maximum number of nodes in a path from the node to the leaf node.
An empty tree is a height-balanced tree. A non-empty binary tree is a height-balanced binary tree if
1. The left subtree of a binary tree is already the height-balanced tree.
2. The right subtree of a binary tree is also the height-balanced tree.
3. The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree must not more than ‘1’.
Output: 'true'

Sample Input 1:
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 5 -1 -1
Expected Answer:
false
Output on console:
false
Explanation of sample input 1:
Consider the root  Node ( 1 ) 
Left subtree height is ‘3’ ( 1->2->4->5) and right subtree height is ‘1’ ( 1->3), the absolute height difference is ‘2-1 = 2’ and ‘2’ is more than ‘1’ so subtree at Node ( 1 ) is not a height-balanced binary tree.
Hence we return ‘false’.
Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 -1 -1
Expected Answer:
true
Output on console:
true

class Node
{
int data;
Node left;
Node right;
Node(int data)
{
this.data=data;
this.left=null;
this.right=null;
}
}

class Solution
{
public static boolean isbalanced(Node root)
{
  return height(root)!=-1;
}
public static int height(Node root)
{
if(root==null) return 0;
int lheight=height(root.left);
if(lheight==-1) return -1;
int rheight=height(root.right);
if(rheight==-1) return -1;
if(Math.abs(lheight-rheight)>1) return -1;
return 1+Math.max(lheight,rheight);
}
